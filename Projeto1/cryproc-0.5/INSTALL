To compile Cryproc, run:
make
in the project's directory. This will generate the binary files: cryproc.ko
(the kernel module) and cryproc-tool (the command-line utility for accessing
/proc/cryproc). You can also use:
make debug
to compile the kernel module with extra debugging information (using the debug-
enabled version may fill your logs with quite a lot of data!).
To load the module, use:
insmod cryproc.ko
Usage instructions for cryproc-tool can be found in the README.
